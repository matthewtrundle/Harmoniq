  "prompt": "An ultra-modern, photorealistic digital painting in the style of Syd Mead and Beeple, depicting an abstract representation of digital health transformation.  Geometric shapes, reminiscent of vintage medical instruments (stethoscopes, syringes, EKG lines), morph and seamlessly transition into sleek, futuristic digital interfaces and data streams.  The background is a deep, atmospheric dark gradient transitioning from obsidian black to a deep indigo, punctuated by vibrant neon accents of electric blue, pulsating fuchsia, and lime green, illuminating the transforming shapes.  Cinematic lighting emphasizes the volumetric qualities of the shapes, creating sharp highlights and deep shadows. The overall mood is one of dynamic technological advancement, blending the legacy of analog medicine with the boundless potential of digital healthcare.  Composition should be a dynamic interplay of positive and negative space, with the morphing shapes creating a sense of movement and energy flowing across the frame.  Focus on intricate detail and reflective surfaces, showcasing a highly polished, futuristic healthcare technology aesthetic.  Resolution: 8k.\n",
