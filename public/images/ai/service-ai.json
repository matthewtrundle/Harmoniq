  "prompt": "An ultra-modern, artistic rendering of an AI brain, meticulously crafted from interconnected circuit boards, pulsating with a soft, internal cyan glow.  The brain is centrally positioned, analyzing detailed medical scans projected as floating, holographic displays in vibrant orange and cyan hues. These displays showcase intricate anatomical structures, radiating a subtle, ethereal light. The surrounding environment is a sleek, dark tech laboratory, featuring polished obsidian surfaces, subtly glowing neon accents of cyan and orange, and complex, futuristic medical equipment in the background, blurred for depth of field. Cinematic lighting emphasizes the AI brain and the holographic displays, casting dramatic shadows and highlights. The overall mood is one of intense focus and technological marvel, with a photorealistic quality and a color palette dominated by deep blacks, accented by vibrant cyan and orange neon.  The composition should be balanced, with the AI brain as the clear focal point, surrounded by a halo of holographic data and the suggestive presence of advanced medical technology. Render in 8k resolution with meticulous detail, showcasing the intricate textures of the circuit boards and the crisp clarity of the holographic projections. Emphasize subsurface scattering effects on the circuit boards for a sense of depth and realism. The overall style should be dark, moody, and cinematic, evoking a sense of awe and mystery.\n",
