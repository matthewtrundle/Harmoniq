Patient data streams visualized as vibrant, flowing light streams in shades of electric blue, teal, and deep violet, interwoven with subtle, almost invisible data trails.  The background is a deep, charcoal black, punctuated by accent lighting in cool blues \u2013 a soft, diffused glow emanating from beneath the screens and subtly highlighting the glass's edges.  The overall composition is centered, with the glass screens dominating the frame, creating a feeling of depth and immersion.  The mood is calm, sterile, yet technologically advanced and hopeful, exuding a sense of high-tech medical precision and futuristic optimism.  The style is ultra-modern, bordering on art deco with clean lines and geometric forms; the lighting is meticulously crafted, utilizing volumetric lighting and subtle reflections to enhance the realism and depth of the scene.  High detail, 8k resolution, intricate details in the data streams, Ray Tracing, Global Illumination.  Focus on sharp, crisp detail and realistic material rendering for the glass screens.\n",
