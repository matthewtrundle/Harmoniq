  "prompt": "A photorealistic, ultra-modern visualization of a global network of interconnected medical facilities, rendered on a dark, rotating globe.  Each facility is represented by a glowing, pulsating node, varying in size and intensity based on activity level, emitting a cool, electric blue and vibrant teal light.  These nodes are interconnected by shimmering, neon-green data streams, flowing dynamically between them, creating a complex web of light across the globe's surface.  The background is a deep, inky black, punctuated by subtle nebula-like swirls of deep purple and indigo, enhancing the futuristic ambiance. Cinematic lighting, with a strong key light highlighting the network's activity, and subtle rim lighting emphasizing the globe's curvature, creating a sense of depth and drama. The overall mood is one of technological advancement and global interconnectedness, emphasizing both the power and fragility of the global healthcare system.  The style is sleek, artistic, and detailed, with a photorealistic rendering emphasizing the glowing nodes and data streams.  Focus on sharp details and high contrast to create a visually striking and memorable image.  Resolution: 8K.\n",
