  "prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic rendering of a futuristic medical research laboratory bathed in deep blues and violets, accented by vibrant neon pink and electric blue highlights.  The background is a dark, almost obsidian black, punctuated by glowing circuitry embedded in the walls.  Scientists in sterile white lab coats, illuminated by the neon accents, interact with shimmering holographic interfaces that project intricate 3D models of cellular structures and genetic sequences.  Floating AR displays, translucent and displaying complex data streams in a futuristic, minimalist font, hover around their workstations.  The overall mood is one of intense focus and scientific discovery, with a subtle sense of awe and mystery. The composition should emphasize depth, with a central focus on a group of scientists collaborating around a large holographic projection, while other scientists are subtly visible in the background, working at their individual stations.  The lighting should be sharp and dramatic, with neon light reflecting off polished chrome surfaces and creating vibrant highlights on the scientists' faces and equipment.  The level of detail should be hyperrealistic, showcasing the intricate textures of the lab equipment and the subtle expressions on the scientists' faces.  The style should be ultra-modern and artistic, evoking a sense of both technological advancement and human ingenuity.  8k resolution.\n",
